# Diamonds Regression Analysis

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and a dataset used for a regression analysis on diamond prices.

## Files

* `diamonds.csv`: The dataset containing information about various diamonds, including their price and other attributes.
* `V1_Diamonds regression.ipynb`: This notebook likely covers the initial steps of the regression analysis, such as data loading, exploration, and potentially basic preprocessing.
* `V2_Diamonds regression.ipynb`: This notebook appears to delve deeper into the regression analysis, possibly including more advanced feature engineering or model building.
* `V7_Diamonds regression.ipynb`: This notebook seems to contain further iterations or refinements of the regression model, potentially including model evaluation and interpretation of results.

## Getting Started

To run these notebooks, you'll need to have Jupyter Notebook installed, along with the necessary Python libraries.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Statsmodels

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install jupyter pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy scipy statsmodels
````

### Usage

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2.  Navigate to the cloned directory:

    ```bash
    cd Diamonds-Regression-Analysis
    ```

3.  Start Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

4.  Open the `.ipynb` files in your browser to view and run the analysis.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a regression model to predict diamond prices based on their characteristics. The notebooks demonstrate various steps of the data science pipeline, from data cleaning and exploration to model training and evaluation.
